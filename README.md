# Mental Health Support Website

This repository contains the source code for our Mental Health Support Website. The website is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of services for individuals dealing with mental health issues.

## Features

- **Mental Disorder Tests**: Our website offers a variety of self-assessment tests for various mental disorders. These tests are designed to help users understand their mental health better and are not a substitute for professional diagnosis.

- **Community Support**: We provide a platform for users to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. This community support system can be a valuable resource for sharing experiences, advice, and encouragement.

- **Counselling Services**: Our website connects users with professional counsellors who can provide guidance and support. These services are available via chat, video call, or in-person meetings.

- **Non-Conventional Coping Methods**: We understand that traditional methods may not work for everyone. Therefore, we provide resources and guidance on non-conventional coping methods such as art therapy, music therapy, and mindfulness techniques.
